<p>
I lead the research efforts at Megagon Labs, located in Mountain View,
California. Prior to joining Megagon Labs, I was  a Professor of
Computer Science 
at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>.  
I also spent two years at 
<a href="http://research.ibm.com/labs/almaden/">IBM Research - Almaden</a>.
I received
my B.Sc. (First Class) in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg">National
University of Singapore</a> and my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the
<a href="https://www.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a>. 
</p>
<p>
I grew up in Singapore, a tropical island at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. After completing my bachelor degree in Singapore, I spent five memorable years at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where I obtained my Ph.D. degree. Now, I live in San Jose, California, with my husband and two lovely children, whom I spend most of my free time with.
